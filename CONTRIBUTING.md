## üîÑ Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

Always create a new branch for your work:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

Branch naming conventions:
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Adding tests
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Follow the existing code style
- Write clear, concise comments
- Update documentation as needed
- Add tests if applicable

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run the app and test manually
npm start

# Check for errors
npm run lint  # (if configured)
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add amazing new feature"
```

### 5. Push to Your Fork

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 6. Create Pull Request

Go to GitHub and create a Pull Request from your fork to the main repository.

## üíª Coding Standards

### JavaScript Style Guide

```javascript
// ‚úÖ Good
const getUserLocation = async () => {
  try {
    const location = await Location.getCurrentPositionAsync();
    return location;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Location error:', error);
    return null;
  }
};

// ‚ùå Avoid
function getlocation(){
const loc=await Location.getCurrentPositionAsync()
return loc
}
```

### Key Principles

1. **SOLID Principles** - Single Responsibility, etc.
2. **DRY** - Don't Repeat Yourself
3. **KISS** - Keep It Simple, Stupid
4. **Meaningful Names** - Use descriptive variable/function names

### File Organization

```
- Components should be in PascalCase: `FacilityCard.js`
- Hooks should start with 'use': `useFacilities.js`
- Utils in camelCase: `helpers.js`
- One component per file
- Group related files in folders
```

### Code Comments

```javascript
/**
 * Fetch facilities from API based on location
 * @param {Object} location - User's current location
 * @returns {Promise<Array>} Array of facility objects
 */
export const fetchFacilities = async (location) => {
  // Implementation
};
```
